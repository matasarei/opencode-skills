## Moodle conventions

This repository root **is** the plugin root; in a running site it lives under the matching
`<moodle>/<type>/<name>/` directory. The code cannot run standalone — it needs a Moodle install
around it, which is why entry-point pages `require_once` the host's `config.php` by relative
path.

### Coding style

- **4 spaces**, never tabs. Unix line endings. No trailing whitespace.
- Aim for **132 characters** per line; never exceed 180. Language strings are exempt.
- **Classes and functions:** lowercase with underscores (`some_custom_class`), prefixed with the
  component name where the API expects it. **Constants:** uppercase with the component prefix.
- **Variables:** lowercase, whole English words, plural for arrays.
- `<?php` only, and **no closing `?>`** at end of file.
- Non-entry-point files start with `defined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die();`.
- Short array syntax `[]`. `true` / `false` / `null` lowercase.
- Opening brace on the same line; braces always, even for one-line bodies. `else if`, not
  `elseif`.
- New classes live under `classes/` with a namespace matching the path. One namespace per file,
  individual `use` statements.
- New code carries **type hints and return types**, and a docblock with `@param` / `@return` in
  lowercase type names.
- Prefer `$var ?? $default` over long ternaries.

### SQL

- **Every variable goes in a placeholder.** Named parameters where there is more than one.
  String concatenation into a query is a defect, not a style preference.
- `{table_name}` braces for tables. Keywords UPPERCASE. Double-quoted query strings.
- `AS` for column aliases, never for table aliases. `JOIN` rather than `INNER JOIN`; no
  `RIGHT JOIN`. `<>` rather than `!=`.
- Whole queries through `$DB->get_records_sql()` / `get_recordset_sql()` / `execute()`;
  fragments through the `_select()` variants.
- Use `get_recordset_*` and iterate when the result set can be large — `get_records_*` loads
  everything into memory.

### Security — the parts that are easy to skip

Each of these is a **blocker**, because bypassing them produces code that looks correct and
works in testing.

- **Never read `$_GET`, `$_POST` or `$_REQUEST` directly.** Use `required_param()` /
  `optional_param()` with the tightest `PARAM_*` type that fits (`PARAM_INT`, `PARAM_ALPHANUMEXT`,
  `PARAM_TEXT`). The type *is* the validation.
- **`require_login()` on every entry point**, with the course or module context where relevant.
- **`require_capability()` for authorisation**, checked against the real context. Hiding a menu
  item is not access control — the URL is still reachable. Capabilities are declared in
  `db/access.php` with sane `archetypes` and a `riskbitmask` that reflects what they allow.
- **`require_sesskey()` on anything that changes state.** A GET that deletes, or a POST with no
  session key, is a cross-site request forgery hole.
- **Escape on output**: `s()` for plain text in HTML, `format_string()` for short strings such
  as names, `format_text()` for anything with markup. Echoing a database value directly is XSS.
- **Never** `eval()`, backticks, `preg_replace()` with `/e`, `goto`, or `unserialize()` on
  anything a user can influence.
- **Files go through the Moodle File API**, not `fopen`/`move_uploaded_file` into a web-readable
  path.
- **Spreadsheet and CSV exports carry a formula-injection risk**: a cell beginning `=`, `+`, `-`
  or `@` is executed when the file is opened. Write user-controlled text with
  `setCellValueExplicit(..., DataType::TYPE_STRING)`, and write real numbers as
  `TYPE_NUMERIC` so they stay sortable.

### Things that break only on the live site

- **Bump `$plugin->version` in `version.php`** whenever you add or move a file under `classes/`,
  or change `db/` schema, `db/caches.php` or `db/tasks.php`. Moodle caches the class map and the
  schema version; without the bump the site keeps running the old code and you get a
  "class not found" that reproduces nowhere else. When unsure, bump — it is cheap.
- Schema changes belong in `db/upgrade.php` (or `db/tables/`) guarded by a version check, and
  the guard version must match the new `version.php` value.
- Capability changes require the version bump too, or the new capability will not exist.

### JavaScript

- AMD/ES6 modules in `amd/src`, built to `amd/build`. Never edit `amd/build` by hand and never
  commit `node_modules`.
- camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes, UPPERCASE for constants.
- jQuery and YUI are not used in new code, only where interfacing with legacy code.
- Return a promise or a value; chain rather than nest.
