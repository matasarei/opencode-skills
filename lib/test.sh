# Run this project's tests and say in one line what happened.
#
# Every skill used to spell this out as prose: pick `test` or `testScoped`, wrap
# it in `timeoutTool`, run it, then quote "the runner's result line". That is
# four judgement calls, and a model that drops any one of them reports "tests
# pass" with nothing behind it. They are decided here instead.
#
#   test.sh                    the profile's `test`
#   test.sh --scoped <name>    the profile's `testScoped`, with {name} filled in
#   test.sh --red <name>       the same scoped run, before the code it tests exists:
#                              the test has to fail, and fail as a test
#
# The first line of output is always the verdict, carrying the runner's own
# summary so it can be quoted as evidence:
#
#   TEST PASS | OK (43 tests, 118 assertions)
#   TEST FAIL | FAILURES! Tests: 43, Assertions: 118, Failures: 1.
#   TEST MISSING — no test command in the profile; this repository may have none
#   TEST TIMEOUT — no result after 600s; a hang is a failure, not a slow pass
#
# On anything but PASS the runner's last 20 lines follow, so the failure can be
# read without running it again. Exit 0 pass, 1 fail or timeout, 2 nothing ran.
#
# The verdict is also written to .devskills/test-result as "<HEAD sha> <verdict>",
# so /dev-pr can tell whether anything was actually run for the code it is about
# to propose, instead of taking the model's word for it.
#
# --red answers a different question — was this test red before the change? — so
# it has its own verdicts, first line as always:
#
#   RED PROVEN | FAILURES! Tests: 1, Assertions: 1, Failures: 1.     exit 0
#   RED NOT PROVEN — the test passed before the change; …          exit 1
#   RED UNCLEAR | <summary>                                          exit 1
#
# PROVEN needs a test that ran and failed. A failure with no failing-test count —
# a parse error, a collection error, a build failure, a runner not recognised
# below — is UNCLEAR: something broke, but not necessarily the test. It writes
# .devskills/red-result as "<HEAD sha> <branch> <name> <verdict>" — "-" for the
# branch on a detached HEAD — and never .devskills/test-result: a deliberate
# failure is not the change's test verdict.
